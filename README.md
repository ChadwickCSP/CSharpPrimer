# CSharpPrimer

## Overview

In this project, you will take a deep dive into C# programming independently from Unity. The goal of this project is to give you a base level understanding of all of the coding concepts required to pass the AP Exam.

## Setup your repository

### Sign up for Project

Sign up for the project repository here: 
[TODO]()

After your repository has initialized it, clone it to your computer. I recommend
putting it in your `ap-csp` directory.

After you've cloned your repository, run the `setup.sh` script in the root of
that repository to initialize it's configuration.

Upon completion it should display a message similar to this one:

```
######################################################
# SETUP IS COMPLETE. YOU SHOULD NOW CREATE A         #
# `develop` BRANCH BY RUNNING THE FOLLOWING COMMAND: #
#                                                    #
# git checkout -b develop                            #
#                                                    #
# THEN PUSH THAT BRANCH TO GITHUB BY RUNNING THE     #
# FOLLOWING COMMAND:                                 #
#                                                    #

#                                                    #
# AFTER PUSHING, OPEN A PULL REQUEST FROM YOUR       #
# `develop`  BRANCH TO THE `main` BRANCH BY VISITING #
# THIS REPO ON GITHUB, CLICKING `Pull Requests`      #
# THEN `New pull request`. THE BASE BRANCH SHOULD BE #
# `main` and THE COMPARE BRANCH SHOULD BE `develop`. #
#                                                    #
# FINALLY, ADD YOUR INSTRUCTOR AS A REVIEWER ON      #
# GITHUB. THIS IS HOW YOUR INSTRUCTOR WILL SEE YOUR  #
# WORK.                                              #

Follow the directions to create a `develop` branch as well as pushing your
`develop` branch to Github.

Finally, create a pull request from your `develop` branch to the `main` branch
and assign `jcollard` as a reviewer.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1

Due: Thursday Feb. 25th @ 8am

We will be utilizing a Code Academy course to provide practice problems to work on throughout this project. This course is free and provides plenty of practice problems to help build your C# programming abilities.

Code Academy Course: [LINK](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp)

To begin, you will need to sign up for free. You should do this with your chadwick email address.

For Milestone 1, you are expected to sign-up for the course and complete Lessons 1 and 2.1 Each lesson has a quiz that you must complete to move to the next. To turn in your solution, you must copy your answer from Code Academy's interface into the correct file in this repository. For example, the first quiz for lesson `Hello World` is called `2. Run Some C#`. After you have completed this programming challenge, you will copy your code from the web interface into Visual Studio Code replacing the file present in `Hello Worlds/2. Run Some C#/Program.cs`. You should make a `git commit` and `git push` after each quiz is completed to log the time that the quiz was completed. You are expeted to complete quizzes throughout the duration of the project not all the night prior to turning in the project. To receive full points for Skills of a Student you will need to utilize your time both in and out of class well.

All code that you would like to count toward your evaluation should be part of a
`tag` on in your repository called `milestone-1`. This can be created by running
`git tag milestone-1`. Then push your tag to your repository by running `git
push -u origin milestone-1` The date of this tag creation will be used to
determine when your work was submitted. 

### Milestone 2

Due: Monday March. 1st @ 8 AM

For Milestone 2, you are expected to complete Lesson 2.2 and 2.3 and all quizzes present in this repository for those sections

All code that you would like to count toward your evaluation should be part of a
`tag` on in your repository called `milestone-2`. This can be created by running
`git tag milestone-2`. Then push your tag to your repository by running `git
push -u origin milestone-2` The date of this tag creation will be used to
determine when your work was submitted. 

### Milestone 3

Due: Thursday March 4th @ 8 AM

For Milestone 3, you are expected to complete Lessons 3.1 and 3.2 and all quizzes present in this repository for those sections.

## Getting Help

All questions should be posted to the class Piazza board. You are also
encouraged to help other students who post on Piazza. When you post your
question, be sure to include as many details as possible for reproducing the
issue you're having.

Questions you should answer when asking a question include:

1. What are you trying to do?
2. What did you try?
3. What was the result?

Work hard to make sure the person trying to answer your question can reproduce
your error. Share your files so others can run exactly what you're running.

Also, include screenshot!

Formulating good questions is a good life long skill. You should try asking your
question on Piazza before seeking out synchronous time with Mx. Collard.
However, if you would like to meet to discuss synchronously, first, look at [Mx.
Collard's Calendar](http://tinyurl.com/mx-collard-calendar), then send them an
email with at least two proposed times you would like to meet.
